# Keytool Manager

A Graphical tool to manage Java keystores. I built this because there is no graphical alternative for the java keytool that installs on debian based linux distributions.

The tool compiles to a .deb package that I plan to upload to the debian repositories as soon as I can figure out how.

Download the debian package here https://github.com/giepa/keytool-manager/blob/master/dist/keytool-manager.deb
